# ToDo Backend

A simple and efficient backend application for managing tasks (ToDos) using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

- Add new tasks  
- Edit existing tasks  
- Delete tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Organized structure with controllers, models, and routes  

## Technologies Used

- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB  
- Mongoose  

## How It Works

1. The server connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.  
2. Users can perform CRUD operations on ToDos through API endpoints.  
3. The routes handle the requests and call the corresponding controller functions.  
4. The data is stored and managed in MongoDB collections.
